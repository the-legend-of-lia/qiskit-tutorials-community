    "## _*Using Qiskit Aqua for partition problems*_\n",
    "\n",
    "This Qiskit Aqua Optimization notebook demonstrates how to use the VQE algorithm to compute a balanced partition of a set of numbers. This problem is known as \"number partitioning\" or simply \"partition\" in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is defined as follows. We are given a set of numbers $S$, and we want to determine a partition of $S$ into disjoint sets $S_1, S_2$ such that $|\\sum_{a \\in S_1} - \\sum_{a \\in S_2}|$ is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of numbers provided as an input is used first to generate an Ising Hamiltonian, which is then passed as an input to VQE.  As a reference, this notebook also computes the maximum stable set using the Exact Eigensolver classical algorithm and the solver embedded in the commercial IBM CPLEX product (if it is available in the system and the user has followed the necessary configuration steps in order for Qiskit Aqua to find it).  Please refer to the Qiskit Aqua Optimization documentation for installation and configuration details for CPLEX."
