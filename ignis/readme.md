# Quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation with Qiskit Ignis

In this folder we have a collection of great tutorials from our fantastic Qiskitters describing various concepts in quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation.

* [Incoherent Noise](coherence-overview.ipynb): Overview of common sources of incoherent noise on quantum devices (e.g. T1 and T2) and what experiments used used to measure these noise parameters.

* [Measurement Error and Mitigation](measurement_error_mitigation.ipynb): Introduction to measurement, assignment error and how to mitigate.

* [State and Process Tomography Overview](tomography-overview.ipynb): Introduction to state and process tomography and different representations of a quantum process.

* [Hamiltonian Parameters](hamiltonian.ipynb): Introduction to the Hamiltonian for a multi-qubit circuit and how the Hamiltonian transforms to the dressed basis, leads to dispersive shifts used for qubit state measurement and gives rise to ZZ.

* [Gate Errors](gate_errors.ipynb): Introduction to error amplification sequences and a derivation of the amplitude error amplification sequence fit function.

* [Randomized Benchmarking](RB_overview.ipynb): Introduction to randomized benchmarking (RB), which is a scalable technique for measuring the average gate error. 

* [Advanced Randomized Benchmarking Methods](RB_advanced.ipynb): Randomized benchmarking methods for estimating various types of noise errors: interleaved and purity RB.

* [Quantum Volume](QV_overview.ipynb): Introduction to Quantum Volume (QV) which is a single-number metric that can be measured using a concrete protocol on near-term quantum computers of modest size.

* [Repetition Code](repetition_code.ipynb): A guide to compiling repetition code circuits to run on real devices.

## Contributing

Quantum characterization is such an interesting topic and we have by no means covered everything! We welcome additional notebooks in the relevant folder.
