    "## Backends\n",
    "\n",
    "Backends are environments which run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the \"real\" work of quantum processing takes place \"remotely\". Here, \"remotely\" may possibly mean \"in the Qiskit Aer simulator on the user's own workstation\". In that case, communication still takes place in the same communication model, whether it's a local simulator, a remote simulator in the cloud, or a remote IBM Q quantum processing unit in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the backends you encounter will be one of the following:\n",
    "* the Qiskit Aer simulator running on your local workstation\n",
    "* the [IBM Q](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) simulator running in the cloud\n",
    "* one of the [IBM Q](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) cloud-hosted quantum processors\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit provides an abstract backend and communicates with backend implementations via protocols, such as [JSON](https://www.json.org/) documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom backends\n",
    "Qiskit is open source: anyone can write a backend implementation and host their own services reachable by Qiskit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A backend may be\n",
    "* a simulator\n",
    "* an IBM Q (or other) quantum processor\n",
    "* an abacus operated by a clockwork automaton\n",
    "* a little old person in a backroom with paper and a pencil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two are implemented by Qiskit and IBM Q Experience. The latter two exotic possibilities mentioned above can be implemented by you or others when you create new backend implementations."

    "## Qasm and Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Qasm quantum assembly language is a theoretical gate model which evolved independently of IBM in the quantum computing community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorists express quantum operations using linear algebraic expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qasm high-level operators represent quantum operations taking arguments of register and other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "These textual specifications of operations are rendered into [circuit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/visualizing_a_quantum_circuit.ipynb) form. Those circuits are then [transpiled](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/using_the_transpiler.ipynb) into a sequence of low-level operations of typically limited variety offered by the target backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qasm can express circuits and circuits can express qasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, your Qiskit program creates a Circuit from your qasm code. Transpilation happens automatically. Then your Qiskit program submits the circuit derived from your qasm code to the backend as a Job for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmable levels exist below the higher level of qasm. Such matters are part of [OpenPulse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03452.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpilation\n",
    "\n",
    "When qasm programs are **transpiled** (compiled with transformation) for backend consumption, they may be transpiled into longer or shorter strings of lower level operators called \"basis gates\", i.e., the limited set of operators physically or virtually implemented at the next level which will be receiving the transpilation output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit offers visibility into the output of transpilation."
