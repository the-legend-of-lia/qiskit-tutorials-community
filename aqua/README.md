# Qiskit Aqua Tutorials 

Qiskit Algorithms for QUantum Applications (Qiskit Aqua) is a library of algorithms for quantum computing
that uses [Qiskit Terra](https://qiskit.org/terra) to build out and run quantum circuits.

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples showing how to run algorithms in Qiskit Aqua.
There are also Python code files too.

For more detail see the main [index](../index.ipynb#aqua)

## Domains

Aqua provides a library of cross-domain algorithms upon which domain-specific applications and stacks can be
built. Tutorials and sample code may be found here for:

* [Qiskit Chemistry](../chemistry)
* [Qiskit Optimization](../optimization)
* [Qiskit Machine Learning](../machine_learning)
* [Qiskit Finance](../finance)

More information may be found the [main index notebook](index.ipynb).
